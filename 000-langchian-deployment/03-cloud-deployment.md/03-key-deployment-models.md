## üîπ **3.1.3 Key Deployment Models: PaaS, IaaS, Serverless**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. What Is It?

Cloud platforms offer different **deployment models** based on how much infrastructure control and responsibility you want.

The 3 main models are:

| Model       | Full Form                       | Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| **IaaS**    | Infrastructure as a Service     | You manage almost everything |
| **PaaS**    | Platform as a Service           | You manage app + data; cloud manages servers |
| **Serverless** | Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) | You only worry about functions/code |

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Why Do We Need Different Models?

Different LangChain apps have different needs:

| App Type | Best Model | Why? |
|----------|------------|------|
| Large scale or GPU-backed app | IaaS (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine) | Full control over infra, GPU access |
| Web API with vector DB | PaaS (e.g., Render, Azure App Service) | Easy setup, handles scaling for you |
| Simple backend chatbot | Serverless (e.g., Cloud Run, Lambda) | Auto-scale and pay-per-use |

Each model gives you a trade-off between **control**, **ease**, **cost**, and **scalability**.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. When to Use Each Model?

| Model       | When to Use |
|-------------|-------------|
| **IaaS**    | When you need full control (e.g., for GPUs, networking, tuning resources) |
| **PaaS**    | For quick, low-maintenance deployments (e.g., MVPs, internal tools) |
| **Serverless** | For low-latency, event-driven apps (e.g., chat APIs, webhook handlers) |

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Where to Use It?

| Model       | Example Platforms |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **IaaS**    | AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VMs |
| **PaaS**    | Render, Azure App Service, AWS AppRunner |
| **Serverless** | GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions |

### üß† Example

You‚Äôre deploying a LangChain chatbot with Flask API + Chroma DB.

| Model       | What You Do |
|-------------|-------------|
| IaaS        | Spin up a VM, install Docker, manually run app and database |
| PaaS        | Push code to Render, set env vars, and deploy (no infra setup) |
| Serverless  | Upload Docker image to Cloud Run, it auto-scales and runs on request |

### üìå Technical Terms in This Topic

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **IaaS** | You manage OS, runtime, app, data (e.g., EC2) |
| **PaaS** | Cloud provides OS, runtime, load balancing (e.g., Render) |
| **Serverless** | App runs only when requested; scales to zero (e.g., Cloud Run) |
| **Auto-scale** | Cloud adjusts compute resources automatically |
| **Pay-per-use** | You pay only for what you use (e.g., Cloud Run per second billing) |

### üìã Summary Table

| Model       | Control Level | Best For                        | Examples                  |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| IaaS        | üîß Full       | GPU apps, custom OS, networking | AWS EC2, GCP Compute      |
| PaaS        | ‚öôÔ∏è Moderate  | Fast deployment, web APIs       | Render, Azure App Service |
| Serverless  | üß† Minimal    | Low-traffic or event-driven apps| GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda |
