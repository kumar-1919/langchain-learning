## üîπ **3.1.4 Cloud Requirements for LangChain Apps**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. What Is It?

This topic covers the **infrastructure, services, and environment setup** needed to successfully deploy LangChain apps in the cloud.

It includes requirements for:

* Hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU)
* Storage (for vector DBs)
* Networking (exposing APIs)
* Environment variables and secrets

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Why Do We Need It?

LangChain apps often involve:

| Component                  | Why It‚Äôs Needed                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† **LLMs / APIs**         | To process natural language queries                       |
| üóÇÔ∏è **Vector databases**   | To store and retrieve semantic embeddings                 |
| üßÆ **Memory or GPU power** | For large models like Ollama/HuggingFace                  |
| üîê **Secrets management**  | To store API keys, DB URIs securely                       |
| üåê **Networking**          | To expose your app to the internet (via ports, DNS, etc.) |

Without these resources configured properly, cloud deployment can break or be inefficient.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. When to Use It?

Use these requirements:

* Before deploying a LangChain app (set up infra, storage, secrets)
* When migrating from local to cloud
* When scaling to handle real user traffic
* When using GPU-backed models (Ollama, HuggingFace)
* When connecting to remote services (Pinecone, MongoDB, etc.)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Where to Use It?

These requirements apply to:

| Component         | Where It‚Äôs Needed                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| GPU               | AWS EC2, GCP VM, Azure GPU VMs                        |
| Vector DB storage | Cloud volume, local persistent disk, managed DB       |
| Secrets           | Environment variables, Secret Manager (AWS/GCP)       |
| Network Access    | Exposed ports (like `5000`, `8000`), or Load Balancer |
| LLMs              | API access (e.g., OpenAI key) or Ollama local URL     |

### üß† Example

You‚Äôre deploying a Flask-based LangChain app using:

* Ollama for inference (on another server)
* Chroma DB stored locally
* Flask API on port 8000

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs required:

| Requirement | Configuration                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU & RAM   | 2 vCPUs, 4‚Äì8 GB RAM for mid-size apps                          |
| Storage     | Persistent volume (e.g., `/app/db`) for Chroma                 |
| Networking  | Expose port 8000, use `host.docker.internal` for Ollama        |
| Secrets     | Store OpenAI key and DB path in `.env` or cloud secret manager |

| Term                     | Description                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persistent Volume**    | Keeps your vector DB data safe between reboots      |
| **Env Variables**        | Store sensitive config like API keys or model paths |
| **Load Balancer**        | Distributes incoming traffic to your app instances  |
| **Firewall Rules**       | Control network access to your app                  |
| **GPU Instance**         | Cloud VM with NVIDIA GPU for model inference        |
| **Dockerfile / Compose** | Container configuration for your LangChain app      |
