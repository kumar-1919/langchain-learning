Great! Let’s start with:

## 🔹 **2.1 Understanding GPU Inference**

---

### ✅ 1. What is GPU Inference?

**GPU inference** refers to running machine learning model computations (inference, not training) using a **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** instead of a CPU.

In the context of LangChain:

* Inference is when the model **generates text**, **embeds documents**, or **reranks results**
* These tasks can be run faster on a **GPU**, especially for large models

🧠 **Inference ≠ Training**
You’re not teaching the model; you're asking it questions and getting answers.

---

### ✅ 2. Why Do We Need GPU Inference?

Using a GPU:

* ✅ Speeds up inference by **10x to 50x** (vs CPU)
* ✅ Enables running **large models** (like LLaMA, Mistral) that **won’t even fit in RAM** on a CPU
* ✅ Greatly improves **response time** for generation and embedding
* ✅ Makes **local hosting** of LLMs practical

Without a GPU:

* Models run slowly, may crash, or use excessive memory

---

### ✅ 3. When to Use GPU Inference?

Use it when:

* You’re using **local LLMs or embedding models** (e.g., Ollama, HuggingFace)
* You want **faster, low-latency responses**
* You're deploying models that support **CUDA/ROCm**

📌 Especially useful for:

* Embedding large corpora
* Streaming chat generation
* Reranking top-k results from a retriever

---

### ✅ 4. Where is GPU Inference Used?

* ✅ **Embedding models**: Faster document preprocessing
* ✅ **Generation models**: Speedy chatbot or text generation
* ✅ **Reranking models**: Shorter inference time when ranking top documents
* ✅ **LLM pipelines**: Anywhere LangChain calls an LLM synchronously or asynchronously

**Tools that support GPU inference**:

* 🔹 Ollama (if CUDA is installed)
* 🔹 HuggingFace Transformers (with PyTorch + CUDA)
* 🔹 OpenLLM (advanced, supports vLLM, Triton)
* 🔹 Nvidia Triton Inference Server (for advanced cases)

### ⚙️ Example

Let’s say you’re embedding 10,000 documents:

* **CPU time**: \~25–30 minutes
* **GPU time**: \~3–5 minutes

LangChain under the hood:

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

If GPU is available, the model uses it automatically via PyTorch:

```python
# Behind the scenes:
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name).to("cuda")
```
