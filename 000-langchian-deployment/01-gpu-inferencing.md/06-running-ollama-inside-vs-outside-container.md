Excellent! Let’s go to:

## 🔹 **2.2.4 Running Ollama Inside vs Outside Docker**

---

### ✅ 1. What Is This Topic?

This section explains whether you should run Ollama:

* **Inside Docker** (inside a container alongside your LangChain app)
  **OR**
* **Outside Docker** (as a separate service on your host machine)

We’ll compare both approaches for **GPU support**, **stability**, **dev workflow**, and **production deployment**.

---

### ✅ 2. Why Is This Decision Important?

Because:

* 🧠 Running Ollama **inside Docker** **limits GPU support** (unless you use advanced Docker setups like `nvidia-docker`)
* 🧠 Running it **outside Docker** gives **easier GPU acceleration** and **lighter containers**
* This affects your **LangChain app design** — especially for RAG and generation

---

### ✅ 3. When to Run Ollama Outside Docker?

Use this in **most real-world cases**, especially when:

* You want to **use GPU acceleration easily**
* You're running Ollama as a **shared backend** for multiple apps
* You need **modular architecture**: Ollama = model server, LangChain = logic

In this case:

* Ollama runs on host
* LangChain (inside Docker) talks to Ollama via `http://host.docker.internal:11434`

✅ **Recommended setup**

---

### ✅ 4. When to Run Ollama Inside Docker?

Use this only when:

* You need **full isolation** (e.g., Kubernetes pod, dev containers)
* You don’t need GPU, or you're using **`nvidia-docker`**
* You want **one container image** with everything bundled

⚠️ Requires complex Docker setup for GPU:

```bash
docker run --gpus all ...
```

Not beginner-friendly. Adds complexity.

### ⚙️ How to Connect to Ollama from Dockerized LangChain App

✅ If **Ollama is on host**, and LangChain is in Docker:

```python
llm = Ollama(
    model="mistral",
    base_url="http://host.docker.internal:11434"
)
```

✅ If **Ollama and LangChain are in same Docker network**:

```bash
docker network create ollama-net

# Start Ollama container
docker run --name ollama --network=ollama-net ...

# Start LangChain app in same network
docker run --name app --network=ollama-net ...
```

Use:

```python
base_url="http://ollama:11434"
```

### 📌 Pros and Cons

| Mode               | Pros                                       | Cons                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Outside Docker** | ✅ Easy GPU, ✅ Modular, ✅ Simpler dev setup | ❌ Must ensure Ollama is running before app starts |
| **Inside Docker**  | ✅ Fully isolated, ✅ Deploy anywhere        | ❌ Harder GPU access, ❌ Dockerfile becomes heavier |

### 📋 Summary Table

| Aspect            | Inside Docker                            | Outside Docker                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GPU Support       | ❌ Difficult unless using `nvidia-docker` | ✅ Native (host GPU accessible)             |
| Ease of Setup     | ❌ Complex (Dockerfile + GPU drivers)     | ✅ Simple (one-line `ollama run`)           |
| Use in Production | ⚠️ Only with advanced setups             | ✅ Recommended                              |
| LangChain Access  | `http://ollama:11434` (Docker net)       | `http://host.docker.internal:11434` (host) |
