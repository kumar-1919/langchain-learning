Awesome! Let’s move to:

## ⚙️ **1.5 Building and Running the Docker Image**

---

### ✅ What is This Step?

This is where you **create** and **run** a Docker image from your Dockerfile.

It involves two main commands:

1. `docker build` – Creates the image.
2. `docker run` – Starts a container from the image.

---

### ✅ Why Do We Need This?

Until now, we’ve written the Dockerfile — but it doesn’t mean anything until we **build** it and **run it** to:

* Test the containerized LangChain app
* Verify everything works inside the container

---

### ✅ When to Use It?

After:

* Writing a complete Dockerfile
* Creating a `.dockerignore`
* Preparing your `.env` (optional)

Use this step to:

* Run the app locally
* Test the container before deploying to cloud

---

### ✅ Where to Run It?

Run the commands in your project directory (where your Dockerfile exists), from your terminal or VSCode terminal.

---

### 🛠️ Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t langchain-app .
```

**Breakdown:**

* `docker build` – command to build the image
* `-t langchain-app` – names the image
* `.` – refers to the current directory (with Dockerfile)

📝 You can tag versions like this:

```bash
docker build -t langchain-app:v1 .
```

---

### 🚀 Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 langchain-app
```

**Breakdown:**

* `-p 5000:5000` maps **container port 5000** to **host port 5000**
* `langchain-app` is the name of the image

---

### 🔐 Run With `.env` File

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 langchain-app
```

This injects your environment variables into the container.

---

### 🧪 Sample Output

When you run:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 langchain-app
```

You should see:

```
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

Your LangChain app is now live on:
👉 `http://localhost:5000`
