## 🗂️ **3.2 Structure of a Dockerized LangChain Project**

---

### ✅ 1. What Is It?

This topic explains:

> How to **organize your LangChain project files and folders** when preparing it for Dockerization.

It defines a **clean folder structure** that:

* Works well with Docker
* Supports LangChain features like **embeddings**, **vector DB**, **LLMs**, **Flask/FastAPI**, etc.
* Helps maintain **modularity**, **scalability**, and **readability**

---

### ✅ 2. Why Do We Need It?

Because:

* Docker builds require **structured context**
* LangChain projects can include:

  * Models
  * Vector stores
  * APIs
  * Scripts
* A good project layout makes it easier to:

  * **Build Docker images correctly**
  * **Separate logic** (e.g., embedding logic vs app logic)
  * Scale to **larger apps** or microservices

---

### ✅ 3. When to Use It?

Use this structure:

* As soon as your LangChain project grows beyond a single script
* Before you write the Dockerfile (so paths are predictable)
* When planning for **multi-stage builds**, **mounting volumes**, or **CI/CD**

---

### ✅ 4. Where Is It Used?

In any:

* RAG pipeline app (e.g., Flask + Chroma + Ollama)
* Agent-based automation tool
* LangChain app built for deployment

This structure is **Docker-friendly** and **scalable**.

### 📁 Recommended Folder Structure

```plaintext
langchain-app/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              # App entry point (Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
│   ├── rag_pipeline.py      # RAG logic with LangChain
│   ├── embedding.py         # Embedding logic
│   ├── utils.py             # Utility/helper functions
│   └── config.py            # Settings (paths, URLs, env vars)
│
├── data/                    # Source documents (PDFs, markdown, etc.)
│
├── db/                      # Vector DB (e.g., Chroma persistence)
│
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile               # Docker build instructions
├── .dockerignore            # Files to exclude from Docker build context
└── README.md                # Project overview
```

---

### 🧱 Dockerfile References These Paths

For example:

```dockerfile
COPY app/ /app/
COPY requirements.txt .
```

So keeping the right structure avoids:

* Missing files
* Broken paths
* Import errors

### 📌 Technical Terms in This Topic

| Term                  | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entry point**       | The script (e.g., `main.py`) that runs when the app starts             |
| **Modular structure** | Separating code into logical files (e.g., `utils.py`, `config.py`)     |
| **Build context**     | Folder that Docker uses to build your image (`.` by default)           |
| **.dockerignore**     | File listing what Docker should not copy into the image (like `.git/`) |
| **Volume**            | Host-mounted directory to persist data outside of containers           |
| **Vector DB**         | Folder where databases like Chroma persist vector data                 |

### 📋 Summary Table

| Component          | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`             | All source code for LangChain, RAG, embedding, API          |
| `data/`            | Input documents (e.g., PDFs, text files)                    |
| `db/`              | Vector DB persistence (e.g., Chroma)                        |
| `Dockerfile`       | Instructions to build Docker image                          |
| `requirements.txt` | Python libraries needed to run the app                      |
| `.dockerignore`    | Prevents unnecessary files from being added to Docker image |
