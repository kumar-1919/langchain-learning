## 🐋 **3.3 Writing the Dockerfile for a LangChain App**

---

### ✅ 1. What Is It?

The **Dockerfile** is a plain-text script used to define:

> How to **build** the Docker image of your LangChain app — step-by-step.

It includes:

* Base image (e.g., Python 3.10)
* Dependencies installation
* Copying code
* Setting environment variables
* Running the application

---

### ✅ 2. Why Do We Need It?

Because:

* It creates a **self-contained image** of your app
* Ensures reproducibility: same environment every time
* Makes **deployment to any server or cloud** very easy
* Required to use `docker build` and `docker run`

---

### ✅ 3. When to Use It?

* When you are preparing for:

  * Deployment
  * Testing in containers
  * CI/CD pipelines
* When sharing your LangChain app with others
* As soon as the app has **more than 1 dependency** or external resources

---

### ✅ 4. Where to Use It?

* Place it in the **root directory** of your project (e.g., `langchain-app/`)
* Use it locally or in **cloud deployment** (Render, AWS ECS, Azure Web App)
* It's used by the Docker engine during build: `docker build -t myapp .`

### 🔧 Dockerfile Template (for LangChain + Flask App)

```dockerfile
# ✅ 1. Use official Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# ✅ 2. Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# ✅ 3. Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# ✅ 4. Copy all project files
COPY app/ /app/app/
COPY data/ /app/data/
COPY db/ /app/db/

# ✅ 5. Set environment variables (optional)
ENV LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"

# ✅ 6. Expose port (if using Flask/FastAPI)
EXPOSE 5000

# ✅ 7. Start the app
CMD ["python", "app/main.py"]
```

---

### 🧠 Example Requirements (`requirements.txt`)

```
langchain
chromadb
flask
tqdm
pypdf
python-dotenv
```

You can add:

* `ollama` if interacting with it
* `unstructured` for document parsing
* Any custom packages
