## üß© 1.1 What is LangChain?

---

### ‚úÖ What is it?

**LangChain** is an **open-source Python framework** designed to help developers build applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)** by **connecting prompts, models, memory, tools, and external data sources into chains or workflows**.

In simple words:

> üß† ‚ÄúLangChain is the toolkit to build smart apps that talk to LLMs (like ChatGPT) ‚Äî and connect them with files, APIs, tools, and memory.‚Äù

---

### üîç Why do we need LangChain?

**LLMs alone are powerful but limited.**
LangChain gives them the *structure* and *context* they need for real-world use cases.

For example:

* Want your chatbot to remember previous conversations? ‚Üí Use LangChain **Memory**
* Want your AI to search Google or read a PDF? ‚Üí Use LangChain **Tools + Loaders**
* Want to combine all of this into a custom pipeline? ‚Üí Use **Chains**

Without LangChain, you'd have to manually handle all of this using raw APIs.

---

### üìÖ When to use LangChain?

Use LangChain when:

* You want to **combine multiple LLM-related components** like prompts, tools, and memory.
* You are building something more than just a **single prompt** call.
* You need to process documents, handle user sessions, call APIs, or retrieve relevant knowledge from databases.

---

### üåç Where is it used?

LangChain is used to build:

* **RAG systems** (e.g., Chat with your documents)
* **AI Agents** (e.g., AI that uses a calculator, search, or executes code)
* **Chatbots** (context-aware, multi-turn)
* **LLM-powered workflows** (e.g., summarization, classification, question-answering)
* **Enterprise AI systems** (with memory, context sharing, tool usage)

### üß† Technical Terms Used

| Term       | Meaning                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM**    | Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA2)                 |
| **Chain**  | A sequence of components like prompt ‚Üí model ‚Üí output      |
| **Agent**  | An LLM that makes decisions and uses tools                 |
| **Tool**   | Any external function (e.g., search, calculator, API call) |
| **Memory** | Stores past conversations or context for continuity        |
| **Prompt** | The structured input we give to the LLM                    |

---

### üß™ Example

Without LangChain:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or "gpt-4"
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."}
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])

```

With LangChain:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4",
    openai_api_key="your-api-key"  # Or use environment variable instead
)

response = llm.invoke("What is LangChain?")
print(response)

```

Not much difference *yet* ‚Äî but when you add memory, tools, loaders, and chains, LangChain makes it modular and manageable.
