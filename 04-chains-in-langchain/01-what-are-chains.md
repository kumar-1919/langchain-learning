## ✅ 5.1.1 – What are Chains in LangChain?

---

### 🎯 Goal:

Understand what **chains** are in LangChain, why we use them, and how they help in building modular LLM-based applications.

---

## 📘 What is a Chain?

A **chain** is a sequence of operations that passes data step-by-step through different components such as:

* **Prompt → LLM → Output**
* **Prompt → LLM → Post-process → Output**
* **Input → Transform → LLM → Output**

Instead of manually calling each component, a **chain automates the entire pipeline**.

### 🧠 Why Do We Need Chains?

| Reason               | Explanation                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Avoid repetition     | Chains bundle logic for reuse                                      |
| Modularity           | Each part (prompt, LLM, memory) is plug-and-play                   |
| Cleaner code         | Hides boilerplate logic (like prompt formatting or parsing output) |
| Supports composition | You can chain multiple models, tools, or transformations together  |
| Easy integration     | Works smoothly with memory, tools, and agents                      |

## 🔧 Technical Terms Used

| Term                    | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLMChain`              | A basic chain: Prompt → LLM → Output                                      |
| `SimpleSequentialChain` | A linear chain: output of one → input to next                             |
| `SequentialChain`       | Like `SimpleSequentialChain` but with support for multiple inputs/outputs |
| `RunnableSequence`      | LCEL-based chaining tool for clean, declarative pipelines                 |

## 🗺️ Where to Use Chains?

| Use Case             | Example                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Text Generation      | Input → Prompt → LLM → Output                 |
| Question Answering   | Question → Context Injection → LLM → Answer   |
| Multi-step reasoning | Extract → Analyze → Respond                   |
| Chatbot pipelines    | User Input → History → LLM → Reply            |
| RAG System           | Query → Vector Search → Prompt → LLM → Answer |

## 📘 When to Use Chains?

| When...                               | Use a Chain                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| You have more than one LLM operation  | ✅ Yes                                    |
| You use a prompt + LLM + post-process | ✅ Yes                                    |
| You want memory or agent integration  | ✅ Yes                                    |
| You only need one-off LLM call        | ❌ Not required (can call `llm.invoke()`) |

## 🔄 Real-World Analogy

> Think of a **LangChain Chain** like a **factory pipeline**:
>
> * Input material = user input
> * Machines = prompt, LLM, post-processor
> * Final product = useful output
>
> Chains connect all these machines together so they operate smoothly one after another.
