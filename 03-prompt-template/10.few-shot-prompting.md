Great! Let’s begin:

## 📘 4.4.1 – What is Few-shot Prompting?

---

### 🎯 Goal:
Understand what **few-shot prompting** is, **why it's useful**, and how to apply it using LangChain’s `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate`.

---

## 🔍 What is Few-shot Prompting?

Few-shot prompting is a technique where we **provide examples** of input-output pairs (called **shots**) in the prompt, to guide the LLM in generating similar outputs.

These examples help the LLM learn the **task pattern** without needing fine-tuning.

---

### 🧠 Why Do We Need Few-shot Prompting?

| Problem | Few-shot helps by... |
|--------|----------------------|
| LLM is unsure how to respond | Showing examples of correct answers |
| Output format is inconsistent | Providing structured examples |
| Instruction is ambiguous | Guiding model behavior with demos |

---

## 🧱 Few-shot Prompting Structure

```text
Instruction: [what to do]

Example 1:
Input: ...
Output: ...

Example 2:
Input: ...
Output: ...

New Input: ...
Output:
```

This is commonly used in both:

- 🧾 `PromptTemplate` – for text-based examples
- 💬 `ChatPromptTemplate` – for dialog-style examples

---

## 📌 Real Example (Manual Prompt)

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
Classify the sentiment of the review:

Example 1:
Input: I love this product!
Output: Positive

Example 2:
Input: This was terrible and disappointing.
Output: Negative

Now classify this:
Input: {review}
Output:
""")

print(template.format(review="I enjoyed using this app!"))
```

🟢 Output:
```
Classify the sentiment of the review:

Example 1:
Input: I love this product!
Output: Positive

Example 2:
Input: This was terrible and disappointing.
Output: Negative

Now classify this:
Input: I enjoyed using this app!
Output:
```

---

## 💬 Chat Style Few-shot Prompting

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "Translate to Spanish: Hello"),
    ("ai", "Hola"),
    ("human", "Translate to Spanish: Thank you"),
    ("ai", "Gracias"),
    ("human", "Translate to Spanish: {phrase}")
])

messages = chat_prompt.format_messages(phrase="Good morning")
```

🧠 This teaches the model to understand what the user is asking.

## ✅ Benefits of Few-shot Prompting

| Benefit                  | Explanation                                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| No training required     | Examples in the prompt help guide behavior               |
| Custom task behavior     | Show model exactly how you want it to respond            |
| Reduces hallucination    | Ground responses in realistic patterns                   |
| Easier debugging         | You can tweak just the examples without code changes     |

## 📘 Summary Table

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Few-shot Prompting     | Guide LLM with examples in prompt                        |
| Use cases              | Classification, formatting, translation, dialog agents  |
| Template types         | `PromptTemplate`, `ChatPromptTemplate`                   |
| Requires fine-tuning?  | ❌ No, just structured input                             |
| Limitations            | Token limit, examples should be concise & relevant       |
